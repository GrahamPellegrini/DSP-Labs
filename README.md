## 🧪 Practicals Overview

This repository includes 4 hands-on labs, each with an accompanying PDF worksheet and solved notebook.

### Practical 1 – Sampling Theorem
- Signal generation and pulse train sampling
- Power spectrum analysis in time and frequency domains
- Aliasing and effective sampling frequency
- Chebyshev filter design and application to sampled signals

### Practical 2 – IIR Filter Implementation
- First-order IIR filter using intermediate variables
- Impulse and step response analysis
- Filtering real `.wav` audio signals
- Frequency response and power spectra
- Gain and phase calculations across frequencies
- Theoretical vs experimental Bode plots

### Practical 3 – FIR Filter Design (from uploaded PDF)
- FIR system design and frequency response analysis *(Details in worksheet)*

### Practical 4 – DFT and FFT Analysis (from uploaded PDF)
- DFT matrix generation
- Transform properties: conjugation, symmetry, and energy conservation *(Details in worksheet)*

> ⚠️ **Note**: A `venv` or `requirements.txt` file is not included. To run the notebooks, install `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `jupyter` using pip or conda.
